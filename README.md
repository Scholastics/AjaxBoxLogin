# TStyleLogin

TStyleLogin is a small gem that generates the Rails 3 view partial, stylesheet and javascript needed to have a Twitter-style AJAX login box on your app's pages. View can be generated as either ERB or HAML and with HAML you get SCSS instead of SASS for the stylesheet.

TStyleLogin is not compatible with versions of Rails before 3.0. Patches that add such support will be considered.

## Setup

Installs as a gem

    gem install tstyle-login

## Usage

Invoke the tstylelogin generator

    tstylelogin {view_type} {view_path}
    tstylelogin erb shared   => generates ERB/CSS files, with the partial in app/views/shared
    tstylelogin haml layouts => generates HAML/SCSS files, with the partial in app/views/layouts

### Options
* view_type is a string naming the template system to use, currently valid values are 'erb' and 'haml'
* view_path is a string appended to 'app/views' to build the directory name in which the partial is generated

### Note
* tstyle-login.js is always generated to /public/javascripts

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
